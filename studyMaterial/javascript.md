# Javascript

The language is used for many purposes in web development some of which include interacting with a user, validating inputs, changing the contents of a page, sending requests to APIs and so much more. Javascript is the world’s most popular programming language. 

## Syntax and basic constructs:
### Variables: 
    Types: boolean, string, numbers.
    To define variables we use var, let, or const. 
    To name de variables it is customary to use the camel case method (for example if I need to define de variables called ‘first name’ I put ‘let firstName). Another option is to use underscores like ‘first_name’ but is most popular in javascript to use camel case. 
### Semicolons: 
    Every statement should end with semicolons ‘; ‘. 
    Indentation: 
    Any code needs to be indented because is more simple to understand. 
### Comments: 
    A comment is an un-executable code. They’re useful for providing an aplanation of some code within a program. They use to be 
    // This is a comment (for one row)


    /*
    This is a comment 
    for a block of code 
    */

### Identifiers:
    In Javascript, the name of a variable, function, or property is known as an identifier. You can use letters, numbers, $, or _. They cannot begin with numbers and other symbols are not permitted. 
    It is also case sensitive, so javascript is different from Javascript. 

### Reserved word: 
    Like other programming languages, Javascript has a lot of many different reserved words like break, do, instanceof, typeof, case, else, new, var, catch, finally, return, void, continue, for, switch, while, debugger, function, this, with, default, if, throw, delete, in, try, class, enum, extends, super, const, export, import, and so on. 

### Operators:
    Javascript has arithmetic operators and assignment operators. Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers and assignment operators assign values to javascript variables.
