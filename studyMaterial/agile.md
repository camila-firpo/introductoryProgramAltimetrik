Agile Methodologies

The agile methodology is a process that allows teams to develop and manage a project in stages. The most importants values for this methodologies are:
interactions of people over tools and processes
functional software over exhaustive documentation
collaboration with the client above contractual negotiation
Response to change over following a plan.
Once the client’s expectations are known, planning what the development process will be like is carried out.
Something important to note about agile methodologies is that they allow planning to be adapted as the project progresses and new customer requirements or software production problems arise.

Within the different agile methodologies, the most used in the world of software development is scrum. This process is distinguished by having a board with tickets where each ticket represents a task to be performed. These tasks must be completed in a period of time called “sprints”, which are deadlines of time where tasks must be completed. The tasks of the sprints are taken from the backlog, which is a prioritized list of tasks from the beginning of the project to the end of the project.

Meetings or kick offs are important in scrum. The team meets every day to discuss their daily progress. Also, at the end of each sprint, a retrospective meeting is held where the teammates' work is analyzed and how each one’s work can be improved.
